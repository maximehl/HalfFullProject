            <h3>What's depression?</h3>
            <p>Depression is not just feeling sad--it can make you feel hopeless, unmotivated, or worthless, or gain or
                lose weight rapidly. Depression is linked to insomnia or excessive sleeping, lack of energy, trouble
                concentrating, and suicidal thoughts or a desire to self-harm. It's one of the most common mental disorders,
                and affects many people our age, but it is treatable.<br><br>
                Depression is often correlated with a family history of depression, as well as drug use and high levels
                of stress. Many people with depression find a balance of therapy and antidepressant medication, although
                everyone's different and some things don't work for everyone in the same way. What's important is to keep
                trying.<br><br>While it's hard to self-diagnose, since everyone expresses symptoms differently and you
                might not show all of the well-known symptoms, having a baseline can be helpful. If you're worried you've
                got depression, you can progress through the simple test at "Check in" to find out how urgent it is (in
                our very unprofessional and uninformed opinion) that you get help.<br><br>Please realize that we are not
                professionals! We got all of this information from the resources we listed for you and our personal
                experiences, and while we did our best to make sure it's accurate, you are the best judge of yourself!
                If you're worried about your mental health or feel like you're in a dangerous place, you should consider
                seeking out someone who is qualified to help you. Depression is a disease like any other, and a qualified
                professional is often the best place to go to get help for it. Start with the resources above and make
                sure to do your own research!<br><br> You many not need to continue treatment forever. Depression
                <i>can</i> be cured, and if you're on antidepressants now or prescribed them later, you might not have
                to be forever.

            <h3>Help a friend</h3>
            <p>
                It's difficult to instinctively know how to help someone. If you're worried your friend is depressed,
                you should talk to them--you probably know how best to ask them if they need help, if something has
                happened, or if they just want to talk. If your friend is expressing suicidal thoughts or a tendency to
                self-harm, sometimes the best thing to do is to tell their parents or guardians--this can feel like a
                breach of trust, but it might save their life. If you're worried about your friend's safety, call one of
                the hotlines above and/or their parents. However, your first step should be to talk to them. Tell them you
                care, that you're ready to listen, then <i>listen</i>. If they depression is making them feel unimportant,
                make them feel important--include them, talk to them, listen to them. Your friend needs you.
                <br><br>Depression is sometimes difficult even for a professional to diagnose--don't beat yourself up if
                you didn't notice at first, just be there for them now. Your friend needs support, and you are one of the
                best people to help them right now. You don't have to be the only support--encourage them to reach out to
                others, but be there when you can and make sure they know how much they are cared for. If they feel alone,
                try to show them they're not; if they feel worthless, try to prove them wrong. No matter what might have
                happened (if anything) to cause this, your friend needs you, and your support will be one of the best
                things you can do for them right now.<br><br>
                One other thing to remember--this isn't your fault. You are not the only help for your friend, and if it
                feels that way, don't be ashamed to ask for help. Nobody can do something like this alone--this is why you're
                here, isn't it? So try to be there for your friend, try to help them, but remember that you need help too.
                Keep sharing the love.
